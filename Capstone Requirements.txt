Finalize one capstone idea based on the feedback that you received on your initial ideas and your discussions with your mentor.

The proposal should address the following questions:
What is the problem you want to solve?
Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? 
In other words, what will your client do or decide based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have done otherwise?
What data are you using? How will you acquire the data?
Briefly outline how you’ll solve this problem. 
Your approach may change later, but this is a good first step to get you thinking about a method and solution.
What are your deliverables? Typically, this includes code, a paper, or a slide deck.

Submission instructions:
Write your proposal in a Google Doc (1-2 pages) and submit the link via the “Submit” button. 
Make sure your mentor has permissions to comment on the document.
Work with your mentor to incorporate any feedback into later drafts and submit as many times as needed.
Once your mentor has approved your proposal, convert the doc to a PDF file.
Create a GitHub repository for this project (if you haven’t done so already).
Add the PDF to your GitHub repository for this project.
Share the proposal with your peer community for feedback.

Note: All code and further documentation you write will be added to this repository.

Your project will be evaluated using this rubric.
