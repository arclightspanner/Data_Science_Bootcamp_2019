## Objective
Battlefield 4 is a first person shooter game distributed worldwide on various console
platforms such as the PS3, XBOX and PC. Players compete against one another to
complete different game objectives whether it be flag carrying, getting kills or controlling
a designated area. This capstone collects tens of thousands of player data on the
XBOX ONE platform, in an attempt to analyze which players are most successful and
why they are in the game. The method used to obtain player statistics include web
scraping and API calls. The data includes the kill stats of each player on the XBOX ONE
as well as what weapons and vehicles they used, how accurate their weapon usage is
within the game and how effective they are with certain vehicles. With the data
collected, the capstone summarizes what separates top Battlefield 4 players from the
rest of the player base and also attempts to find additional patterns that is reflected by
the game data.
